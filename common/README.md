# Common

Shared types, DTOs, and utilities for all parts of the project (frontend, mobile, backend, tests).

Ideas:
- `schemas/` — JSON schemas / types
- `models/` — shared domain models
- `utils/` — serialization / validation helpers

Keep this repo-language-agnostic where possible (OpenAPI, JSON Schema, or Protobuf for cross-language contracts).
