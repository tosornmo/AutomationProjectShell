# Backend

This folder will contain the backend application and API implementations.

Structure ideas:
- `src/` — application source
- `tests/` — API and integration tests
- `package.json` — package metadata and scripts

Current plan: create a minimal Node/Express stub as an example; tell me if you prefer another stack (Python/Flask, Go, Java, etc.).
