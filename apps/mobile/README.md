# Mobile App (apps/mobile)

Scaffold for a mobile frontend (recommended: React Native + TypeScript or Flutter).

To get started:
- Choose a stack (React Native with Expo recommended for faster setup).
- I can scaffold a minimal Expo project if you want.

Commands:
- `pnpm --filter @automation/mobile start`
- `pnpm --filter @automation/mobile test`
