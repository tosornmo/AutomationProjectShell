# Frontend (Mobile)

This folder will contain the mobile frontend application (e.g., React Native, Flutter)

Structure ideas:
- `src/` — application source
- `app.json` / `android` / `ios` — platform configs
- `package.json` / `pubspec.yaml` — tooling

Note: Please tell me which mobile stack you prefer (React Native / Flutter / other).
