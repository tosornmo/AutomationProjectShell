# Frontend (Web)

This folder will contain the web frontend application (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte).

Structure ideas:
- `src/` — application source
- `public/` — static assets
- `package.json` — package metadata and scripts

Note: Please tell me which framework you'd like (React / Vue / Svelte / other).
